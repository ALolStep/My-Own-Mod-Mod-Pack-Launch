Compiling

    Download the source from this repo, either with git or as a zip/tarball.

    With Eclipse, open as a project and build as usual

Pull Request Standards

    Indent with tabs
    Avoid trailing whitespace
    Sign-off your commits
    Avoid merge commits in pull requests
    Squash your commits - have at most one commit per major change

Updating your fork

Before submitting a pull request, you should ensure that your fork is up to date. To do this, run these commands:

git remote add upstream git://github.com/Slowpoke101/FTBLaunch.git
git pull --rebase upstream master
git push --force origin <branch_name>

The first command is only necessary the first time. If you have issues merging, you will need to get a merge tool such as P4Merge. Once it is set up, run git mergetool. Once all conflicts are fixed, run git rebase --continue, and git push --force origin <branch_name>.
